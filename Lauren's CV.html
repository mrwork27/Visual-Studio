    <h1>Lauren Thynne</h1>

        <p>
            As a dynamic professional experienced in analytics and business management, I use my creative flair and passion for integrating data into decision making to drive change and innovation. 
            I thrive in a busy and fast paced environment that delivers a challenge, constantly looking to learn and push boundaries with the work I do. After achieving a First Class Honours Bachelors Degree, 
            I pursued an MSc from Loughborough University and achieved a Distinction. Through this, I have developed skills as a team player and leader; therefore I am determined to use these skills alongside my 
            education and experience to improve business capability and expand existing operations- with an innovative slant. Having applied myself in many different extracurricular settings; 
            namely as a cadet in the Air Training Corps, through many different roles at Kent Union, and through various sporting leadership roles I know I can excel in high pressure, time demanding situations.
